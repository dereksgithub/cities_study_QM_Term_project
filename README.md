# Health Outcomes and Place of Residence

This project aim to seek out the relationships of selected health outcomes, risky behaviours and preventive measures. 

The author built regression models to study the and clustering models to classify US counties

The original dataset is pulled from urban institute's mid-sized cities data. While the original dataset offers plenty of interesting insights and sufficient features, it is not fine enough to practice complex models required by the assessment, thus the author incorporated CDC PLACE data, to enrich the original dataset.

The first phase is to solely study the data with quantative measurs, due to the alignment with the course scope, no spatial analysis is done. (Only visualizations)

The second is post module phase, this will introduce analysis with spatial factors in mind, i.e. performing spatial clustering, merging other datasets into the process, (including demographical data, key industrial/retail data) etc.
